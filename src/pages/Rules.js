                <h2>How to Play:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A host will create a game with their own custom bingo tiles. (Up to 50)</li>
                    <li>Players will need to join the room using the room code provided by the host.</li>
                    <li>Players can mark the numbers by clicking on the cells.</li>
                    <li>All players to complete a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) must click the "Bingo" button.</li>
                    <li>If you don't get a bingo, youâ€™ll be redirected to a punishment wheel!</li>
                    <li>Have fun!</li>

                <h2>Punishments:</h2>
                <p>All players will submit a punishment before the game begins. If you don't get a Bingo in time, you'll face a fun punishment from the punishment wheel!</p>
